### Helios Burn - A REST Fault Injection Platform


Helios Burn is a REST fault injection platform that captures HTTP and HTTPS traffic and logs it for users to review. Helios Burn provides the capability to modify HTTP traffic, thus injecting faults, as it is being sent by the client or received from the server. The purpose of Helios Burn is to provide developers with a tool that inject failures and instabilities so that they can verify the stability and resilience of their applications and identify and prevent failures before deploying them into a production environment.
