###Committers

"A Project Managagement committer is a developer that was given write access to the code repository. They have an github account and mail address. Not needing to depend on other people for the patches, they are actually making short-term decisions for the project. The Project Management Commiters(PMC) can (even tacitly) agree and approve it into permanency, or they can reject it. Remember that the PMC makes the decisions, not the individual people."
